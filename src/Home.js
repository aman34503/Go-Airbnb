            <p id='welcome'>Go-Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations in specific locales. On one side, the platform enables people to list their available space and earn extra income in the form of rent. On the other, Airbnb enables travelers to book unique homestays from local hosts, saving them money and giving them a chance to interact with locals.<br/><br/>
            The company has come a long way since 2007, when its co-founders first came up with the idea to invite paying guests to sleep on an air mattress in their living room. According to Airbnb's latest data, it has in excess of 5.6 million listings, covering more than 100,000 cities and towns and 220-plus countries worldwide.<br/><br/></p>
